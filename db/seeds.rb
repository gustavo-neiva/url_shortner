# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])

#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# 10.times do |i|
#   user = User.create!(
#     email: Faker::Internet.email,
#     password: "password", 
#     username: Faker::Internet.username
#   )
#   15.times do |p|
#     title = Faker::Lorem.sentence
#     body = Faker::Lorem.paragraphs
#     created_at = Time.at(0.0 + rand * (Time.now.to_f - 0.0.to_f))
#     Post.create!(
#       title: title,
#       body: body,
#       created_at: created_at,
#       user_id: user.id
#     )
